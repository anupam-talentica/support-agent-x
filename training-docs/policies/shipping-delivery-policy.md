- Business days exclude weekends and public holidays.
- Delivery timeframes are estimates from the date of shipment, not order placement.

## 2. Order Processing

- Orders placed before **2:00 PM** (local time of the warehouse) on a business day are typically shipped the same day.
- Orders placed after the cutoff or on weekends/holidays are processed the next business day.
- You will receive a shipping confirmation email with a tracking number once your order has shipped.

## 3. Tracking

- All orders (except standard international to some regions) include tracking.
- Tracking information is available in "My Orders" in your account and in the shipping confirmation email.
- Tracking may not update for 24–48 hours after the label is created.

## 4. Failed or Delayed Delivery

- If your package is marked "delivered" but you did not receive it, contact us within **7 days** so we can open an investigation with the carrier.
- Delays due to weather, customs, or carrier issues are outside our control; we will assist with tracing but cannot guarantee delivery dates.

## 5. International Shipping

- Customs duties and import taxes are the responsibility of the recipient unless otherwise stated at checkout.
- Some items may be restricted in certain countries; check product pages for eligibility.
