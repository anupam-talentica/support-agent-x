# E-Commerce Support FAQ

This document contains frequently asked questions whose answers are **not** duplicated in the policy documents. Use this when the policy document does not have the answer but the FAQ does.

## Order Tracking

**Q: How do I track my order after I've placed it?**  
A: Log in to your account, go to "My Orders," and click on the order. You will see the tracking number and a link to the carrier's tracking page. You can also use the link in your shipping confirmation email. If you checked out as a guest, use the "Track Order" link in the confirmation email and enter your order number and email.

**Q: My tracking says "delivered" but I didn't receive my package. What should I do?**  
A: First check with household members, neighbors, or building management. If still missing, contact us within 7 days with your order number. We will open an investigation with the carrier. For high-value orders we may require a signed statement or police report before issuing a replacement or refund.

## Coupons and Promotions

**Q: Why is my coupon code not working at checkout?**  
A: Common reasons: (1) The code has expired or reached its usage limit. (2) Your cart does not meet the minimum purchase or product requirements stated in the offer. (3) The code is case-sensitive—try entering it exactly as shown. (4) Some codes cannot be combined with other promotions. If none of these apply, contact support with the code and a screenshot of the error; we can verify eligibility and apply the discount manually if valid.

**Q: Can I use multiple promo codes on one order?**  
A: In most cases, only one promotional code can be applied per order. Exceptions are noted in the specific promotion (e.g., "stackable with free shipping"). Gift cards and store credit can usually be used in addition to one promo code.

## Address and Delivery Changes

**Q: How do I change my delivery address after I've already placed an order?**  
A: If your order has not yet shipped, you can request an address change by contacting support with your order number and the new address. We will update it if the order is still in processing. Once the order has shipped, we cannot change the address; you may need to contact the carrier or refuse delivery and place a new order.

**Q: Can I ship to a P.O. Box or APO/FPO?**  
A: Yes, we ship to P.O. Boxes and APO/FPO addresses for standard shipping. Express and next-day options may not be available to all military or P.O. Box addresses; the checkout page will show available methods for your address.

## Gift Cards and Store Credit

**Q: Where do I find my gift card or store credit balance?**  
A: Log in to your account and go to "Payment methods" or "Wallet." Your gift card and store credit balances are listed there. You can apply them at checkout by selecting them in the payment step.

**Q: My gift card code is not being accepted. What's wrong?**  
A: Ensure you are entering the full code with no extra spaces. Gift cards are case-sensitive. If the card was purchased from a third party, confirm it is activated. If you still have issues, contact support with the card number (you can mask the middle digits) and we will check the balance and status.

## Account and Login

**Q: I forgot my password. How do I reset it?**  
A: On the login page, click "Forgot password." Enter the email associated with your account. You will receive a reset link (valid for 24 hours). If you don't see it, check spam/junk. If you no longer have access to that email, contact support with proof of identity and we can assist with account recovery.

**Q: Can I merge two accounts or move my order history to another account?**  
A: We do not support merging accounts or transferring order history between accounts. You can use one account for future orders. For past orders, keep the old account accessible if you need to reference them or request support.

## Product and Inventory

**Q: Will an out-of-stock item be restocked?**  
A: Product pages often show "Notify me when available." Sign up there to get an email when it's back. Restock dates are not always available; for high-demand items we do our best to restock but cannot guarantee dates.

**Q: I received a different item than what I ordered. What do I do?**  
A: Contact support with your order number and a photo of the item received and the packing slip. We will send the correct item and provide a prepaid return label for the wrong item. You will not be charged for return shipping in this case.

---

## Technical and Checkout

**Q: My payment went through but I didn't get an order confirmation. Did my order place?**  
A: Check your spam folder for the confirmation email. Log in to your account and check "My Orders"—if the order appears there, it was placed. If you see a charge but no order in your account, contact support with the transaction ID or last four digits of your card and the amount; we will look up the order and resend the confirmation.

**Q: I was charged twice for the same order. Why?**  
A: This can happen if you clicked "Place order" multiple times or if the page timed out and you submitted again. Contact support with your order number and we will verify. If it's a duplicate charge, we will refund the duplicate and may combine shipments if both orders have already shipped.
