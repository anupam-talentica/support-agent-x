# Order Cancellation Policy

**Effective Date:** January 1, 2025  
**Document ID:** POL-CAN-004

## 1. Cancellation Window

- You may cancel your order at no charge **before it has shipped**.
- Once an order has been shipped, it cannot be cancelled. You may return the item(s) per our Returns and Refund Policy after delivery.

## 2. How to Cancel

- **Online:** Go to "My Orders," select the order, and click "Cancel order" if the option is available. The option is visible only when the order is still in "Processing" or "Pending" status.
- **With support:** Contact customer support with your order number. We can cancel on your behalf if the order has not yet left our warehouse.

## 3. Refund After Cancellation

- If we successfully cancel your order before shipment, a full refund will be issued to your original payment method within **7 business days**.
- If the order has already been charged and then cancelled, the refund follows the same timeline as in our Refund Policy.

## 4. Partial Cancellation

- For orders containing multiple items, you may request cancellation of specific items only if they have not yet been picked or shipped. If the order has been partially shipped, only the remaining unshipped items can be cancelled.

## 5. Subscription and Recurring Orders

- Subscription orders can be cancelled anytime from your account under "Subscriptions." The cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period; you will not be charged for the next cycle.
